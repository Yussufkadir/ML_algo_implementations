# 🎯 ML/DL Algo Implementations with CPP/C

A collection of machine learning and deep learning algorithms implemented from scratch in C++ for learning and experimentation.

## 📋 Currently Implemented

- ✅ Linear Regression
- ✅ Logistic Regression

## 🔜 In the making 
- CNN

## 🚧 Planned Implementations

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- K-Means Clustering
- Neural Networks (MLP)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- More to come...

## 🛠️ Requirements

- C++17 or higher
- CMake 3.27+
- CLion (recommended) or any C++ IDE

## 🚀 Building & Running
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML_algo_implementations.git
cd ML_algo_implementations

# Build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run
./ML_Algorithms
```

## 📖 Purpose

This project is a work-in-progress collection built for:
- Deepening understanding of ML/DL algorithms
- Practicing modern C++ programming
- Learning low-level implementation details

## 📝 Notes

- Implementations prioritize clarity and learning over production optimization
- Each algorithm is implemented from scratch without external ML libraries
- Project is actively being developed - check back for updates!
